    <H3>Description</H3>
    <p>The boulevardier cocktail is an alcoholic drink composed of whiskey, sweet vermouth, and Campari. Its creation is ascribed to Erskine Gwynne,
       an American-born writer who founded a monthly magazine in Paris called Boulevardier, which appeared from 1927 to 1932. The boulevardier is similar
       to a Negroni, sharing two of its three ingredients. It is differentiated by its use of bourbon whiskey or rye whiskey as its principal component 
       instead of gin. Paul Clark, writing for the food blog Serious Eats, says, "This isn't a Negroni. It is, however, the Negroni's long-lost autumnal 
       cousin. A simple substitution? Hardly. The bittersweet interplay between Campari and vermouth remains, but the whiskey changes the storyline. Where 
       the Negroni is crisp and lean, the Boulevardier is rich and intriguing. There's a small difference in the preparation, but the result is absolutely stunning."
